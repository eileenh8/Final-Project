# Inside Out
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023

## Theme
How you thought about or interpreted the theme:

We interpreted the theme through our visuals. The player begins the game in a black and white cave, the inside, and then progresses to a colorful outdoor setting, the out. Additionally, we incorporated disappearing platforms that also include a contrasting bright color when activated, followed by dullness when inactive. 

## Game Play
Objective and Game-play instructions:
Control player with A, D, and space bar to jump.

Proceed through the game by overcoming the disappearing platforms.
