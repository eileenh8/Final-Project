# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023

## Theme
How you thought about or interpreted the theme
We interpreted the theme through our visuals. The player begins the game in a black and white cave, the inside, and then progresses to a colorful outdoor setting, the out. Additionally, we incorporated disappearing platforms that also include a contrasting bright color when activated, followed by dullness when inactive.
