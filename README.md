# Inside Out
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023

## Theme
We interpreted the theme through our visuals. The player begins the game in a black and white cave, the inside, and then progresses to a colorful outdoor setting, the out. Additionally, we incorporated disappearing platforms that also include a contrasting bright color when activated, followed by dullness when inactive. 

## Game Play
Control player with A, D, and space bar to jump.
